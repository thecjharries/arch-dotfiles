# `arch-dotfiles`

So my Fedora box finally had enough and I thought starting Arch from scratch would be a brilliant idea. I spent most of this weekend relearning how to do all this stuff. It's going to take me some time to get this in a pretty form.

Also I'll have to be way more strategic if I wanna script the early stages of an Arch build.

## Execution Order

1. [general system stuff](./general-setup.yml)
2. [user config scaffolding](./config-setup.yml)
3. [package manage setup](./package-setup.yml)
4. all the other stuff in a specific order

## Things I want to eventually get around to
